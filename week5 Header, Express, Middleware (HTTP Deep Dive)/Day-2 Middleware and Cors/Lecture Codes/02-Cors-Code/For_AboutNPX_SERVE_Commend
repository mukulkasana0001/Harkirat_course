1->if you use comend =  'npx serve ' ,
    then you can share or serve your files or folders (where you called that commend ) in like a intera-net, make sure that ->connect with the same wifi or internet connection



2->if we run frontend and backend on the same post or host(domain) then we dont need cors
  We can use like ,
         
         app.post("/", function(req, res){ 
            res.sendFile(_dirname + "./public/index.html");
         });


         that code means when someone come to '/' then send them that index.html file
