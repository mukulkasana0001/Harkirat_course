********      #!/bin/bash        ********* 

This tells the system to use the Bash shell located at /bin/bash to execute your script.
#!/bin/bash
is called the shebang (or hashbang) and should be the very first line in your Bash script
â€” no blank lines or spaces before it.



EXAMPLE. 
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello, world!"
